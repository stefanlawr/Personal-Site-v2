# Personal-Site-v2

This is the second personal site I've made. My original personal site was based off of the [Ceevee template.](https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/ceevee/)

This version of my personal site is made *mostly* from scratch. I am using some elements from a small CSS framework called [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).

Eventually I will rewrite the CSS to drop the framework, however I still have a lot to learn with advanced CSS features.
