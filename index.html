      <p style="text-align: center">My name is Stefan Strauch, and I am a Computer Science major enrolled at Ramapo
        College of New Jersey. Here on my site you will find my various social media accounts, past projects, current
        projects, information about my education and information on my jobs. The projects on here can be found on my
        Github
        account, and they vary from classwork, high school projects, and miscellaneous projects.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">I began my programming career in high school by taking various programming classes
        in Java. Previously, I had made a handful of modifications to a Java based game called Minecraft. Although they
        were quite simple modifications, the exposure to a full fledge program had piqued my interest. I spent roughly
        2 full school years of classes working with Java; 2 introductory classes, and AP Computer Science. The last
        project I developed in high school was a puzzle game written in Java. My interest in computer science and
        programming took off since. Around the same time of learning programming, I had taken an interest in the
        hardware side of computers. I had built my first desktop from various scrap parts I had from an older computer
        as well as some new ones I ordered online. Since then, I have built multiple computers, including the one I am
        currently using now.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">After starting classes at Ramapo College, my programming skills began to flourish.
        I had been exposed to more and more technologies in the field, ranging from web development to database design.
        Although I had to change from Java to C++, I would later find myself using it again at my current job. With my
        time at Ramapo, I had developed a skillset that would carry me into my first programming job at UPS.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">Currently, I'm working as a full stack developer with another co-op developing
        internal web applications. Our stack consists of Spring Framework for the backend, and Angular 6 with Bootstrap
        4 as our front end. Web development has become something I enjoy, and hope to furhter pursue once I graduate
        from Ramapo.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">As for a little less technical information about me, I picked up bowling in high
        school and have continued to bowl throughout college. I enjoy photography and art, both of which I had taken
        classes for in high school. I also enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends in my free time. My
        tastes in music range from hip-hop to rock, and pretty much everything in between.</p>

          <p>I'm very well acquainted with Java as well as a few other Object Oriented programming languages. These
            include C++, C# and Python. Currently, I'm using Java in my work place by utilizing Spring Framework, and
            C++ in a few of my classes. Java was the language I learned to program in.</p>

          <p>I'm familiar with various web frameworks, Angular being my most proficient. I have some experience working
            with Flask in Python, and ASP.NET in C#. I also have some experience in backend development with ExpressJS.
            As mentioned previously, I have experience with Spring Framework in Java.</p>
